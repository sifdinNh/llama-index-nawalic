    "section_summary": "The text appears to be a transcript of a meeting or session, with a discussion about a proposal and the number of members involved. The president asks for approval from the council, and there is a general agreement. However, when asked about the number of members, one member responds without permission, saying it is unspecified. The president then asks for a specific number, suggesting either 5 or 3 members. There is some hesitation and unclear voices before the president decides on 3 members. The text also mentions the return to the index and the nomination of someone for a committee. The overall content of the text seems to revolve around a legislative session or meeting."
